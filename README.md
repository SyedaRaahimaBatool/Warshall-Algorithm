# Warshall-Algorithm

## Introduction
The Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

### how to use:
* Open Visual Studio
* Copy the code and paste it in your .cs file.
